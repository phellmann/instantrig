- Now “Spine”, “Arm”, “Leg” and “Chain” buttons are be enabled. If they are not, be sure hub bone is selected. That means any of these modules can be branched from hub. Continue creating spine.

- When any part of spine selected, new rollout will be appear on panel named “Spine Attributes”. Change bone count and align chest as you wish. Spine bones cannot be rotated. “Pivot at Middle” option puts controller middle of chest when rig is builded. Otherwise pivot stays as it is.
