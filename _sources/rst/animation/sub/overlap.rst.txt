Overlap Attributes
-------------------

Overlap: 
 Calculates and bakes overlap animations. It saves animation to folder named “recoverAnim” to place where your max file saved before baking new animations.

Recover: 
 Recover loads last animation. If you didnt satisfy overlapped animation with current attributes. You can recover last animation and recalculate overlap with new attributes.

Controller: 
 It allows animator to overlap only position, only rotation or both. 
 
Weight: 
 Multiplier of secondary animation. You can increase or decrease influence. 
 
Tension: 
 If you assume it’s a guitar string, this attribute adjust tightness of string.
 
Drag: 
 If you assume it’s a guitar string, this attribute adjust density of air. High value means you play guitar in the water.
 
Rot Influence: 
 It limits maximum rotation of controller to protect controller from getting flipped if animations are too fast.
 
Reduce keys: 
 Once animation is overlapped it bakes all animations frame by frame. This value reduce keys after animation baked up to this value. Higher value may cause lose fluency of animation.
 
Overlap Range:
 It allows to set range or use active time range for overlapping action.
